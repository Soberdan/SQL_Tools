In this example a variable, @Counter, is set to 10.  Using the WHILE loop to run while the value of the @Counter greater the zero.
Each time the loop is entered, the value of the @Counter variable is decreased by 1. The vaule of the @Counter is converted to the 
character value and printed out each time the loop is entered. When the value is zero, the loop is not entered and the program ends.
